A blog that successfully allows CRUD of of posts and comments. 

Currently only accessible by admin, can be viewed by guests once posts are published by user accounts (admin in this case). Needs registration page to allow more users. 
Deployed via pythonanywhere.com but link is now expired. 
Need to use AWS or Heroku to get it back online.
